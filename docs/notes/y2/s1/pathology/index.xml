Inflammation is protective in nature. Cardinal Signs # Infl. has 5 major cardinal signs (cardinal sign = major signs/symptoms)

It is characterized by exudation of fluid and plasma protein and emigration of leukocytes (predominantly neotrophils).
Acute inflammations have 2 major components:
Vascular changes (vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, etc.) Cellular changes (leukocyte migration then elimination of injurious agent) Previously we have talked about R1 (recognition). These notes talk about R2 (recruitment) and R3 (removal). Vascular and cellular changes discussed here are within R2 and R3.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://axolotz.github.io/mednotes/docs/notes/y2/s1/pathology/3.-mediators/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://axolotz.github.io/mednotes/docs/notes/y2/s1/pathology/3.-mediators/</guid><description>Overview # To avoid tissue injury, the inflammatory response needs to be controlled and regulated.
There are mechanisms in place to control, regulate, and eventually terminate the inflammatory response:
mediators are produced in rapid bursts (not continous) release is stimulus dependent short half-lives degrade after release neutrophil/PMN short life production of stop signals at the end of IR there are neural inhibitors There are major general features of mediators of inflammation:</description></item><item><title/><link>https://axolotz.github.io/mednotes/docs/notes/y2/s1/pathology/4.-morphology/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://axolotz.github.io/mednotes/docs/notes/y2/s1/pathology/4.-morphology/</guid><description>Overview # Morphology is the outward appearance of something (i.e: shape, structure, colour, pattern, size).
The vascular and cellular reactions that characterize acute inflammation are reflected in the morphologic appearance of the reaction.
The main causes are vascular dilation and accumulation of WBCs in extracellular space.
