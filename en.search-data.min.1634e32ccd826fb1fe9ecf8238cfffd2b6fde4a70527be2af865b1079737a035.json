Intro","section":"Community Medicine","content":" Overview # A community is a group of people living in the same place or having common characteristics (geography, interests, experiences, concerns, values, etc.).\nCommunity medicine primarily aims to prevent diseases and promote health deals with healthcare issues affecting communities as a whole Physicians, advanced practice nurse, and sometimes physician assistants can provide community medicine services. Community medicine requires a multidisciplinary approach (focuses on different disciplines/specialties)\nCore subjects involved in comm. med: epidemiology health-care delivery system biostatistics public health nutrition social, behavioural, environmental, and management sciences Health # \u0026ldquo;Health is the state of complete physical, mental, \u0026amp; social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease\u0026rdquo;. (WHO)\nHealth is not a single state, it always changes. It is dynamic and multidimensional (mental, spiritual, physical, etc.) Health results from one\u0026rsquo;s interactions/adaptations with/to their environment. Health status is determined by five domains: genetics social circumstances (education, income, etc.) behavioural choices (diet, exercise, etc.) environmental conditions availability of quality medical care Dimensions # Physical Dimension proper body functioning physical fitness activities of daily life (ADL) Mental Dimension ability to think/reason clearly freedom from internal conflict self-awareness good self-control ability to cope with stress Emotional Dimension self-efficacy and self-esteem Social Dimension ability to have satisfying relationships Spiritual Dimension feeling as a part of a greatur spectrum of existence Enviromental Dimension appreciation for external environment and one\u0026rsquo;s role in it Spectrum # Concept that health is dynamic/ever-changing, not a fixed state. A degradation in health is gradual, not sudden. Thus, health is a \u0026ldquo;spectrum\u0026rdquo; optimum health \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; better health \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; freedom from sickness \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; unrecognized sickness \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; mild sickness \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; severe \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; death Determinants # Health is influenced by many factors known as \u0026ldquo;determinants\u0026rdquo;.\nDefined as: the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age, and the wider set of forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life\u0026quot;. (WHO)\nSocial Determinants of Health can be grouped into 5 major domains:\nEconomic Stability Education access and quality Healthcare access and quality Neighborhood and built environment Social and community context Economic Stability Goal: help people earn steady incomes that allow them to meet their health needs. steady employment = less likely to live in poverty, more likely to be healthy. Education access and quality Goal: increase educational opportunities, help children/adolescents do well in school. higher levels of education = more likely to be healthier and live longer. Healthcare access and quality Goal: increase access to high-quality health care services. no insurance = less likely to have primary care provider, may not be able to afford the healthcare/medications strategies to increase insurance coverage rates help more people get access to important services (e.g: preventive care, treatment for chronic illnesses). Education access and quality Goal: create neighborhoods/environments that promote health and safety. some neighbourhoods may have high rates of violence, unsafe air/water, and other health/safety risks. racial/ethnic minorities and lower income individuals are more likely to live in such places. some work environments may harm health (e.g: secondhand smoke, loud noises, etc.). Social and community context Goal: Increase social and community support. relationships (family, friends, coworkers, etc.) can influence health.

Primary Health Care","section":"Community Medicine","content":" Overview # 3 levels of care: primary, secondary, tertiary\nPrimary first contact with patient responsible for preventative health care Secondary provides curative healthcare facilities patients with abnormalities are referred to secondary Tertiary provides more advanced curative healthcare facilities for specialized healthcare or when there are not enough facilities PHC initially gained gained global prominence in the 1978 Alma Ata Declaration in the Soviet Union.\nThe Alma Ata Declaration states:\nHealth is a fundamental human right and its attainment is an important worldwide social goal. Inequality in the health status of the people (especially between countries) is unacceptable. The people have the right to participate in the planning/implementation of their health care. Government are responsible for the health of their people (by providing adequate health and social measures) All governments should create policies and strategies to launch and sustain PHC All countries should cooperate to ensure PHC for all people Acceptable level of health for all people by year 2000 can be attained by better use of world\u0026rsquo;s resources Primary Health Care # PHC is first-level care provided to a community. It is the first point of contact with the healthcare system, usually through a family physician.\nPHC is rooted in the idea that health is a bio-psycho-social phenomenon, not simply the absence of disease.\nPHC is:\nEssential healthcare Universally accessible to individuals Acceptable to them Through their participation At a cost the community and country can afford This can be remembered with the abreviation EUAPC\nPHC includes:\nHealth promotion Illnes prevention Care of the sick Advocacy Community Development Functions # provide continous and comprehensive care refer to specialists and/or hostpital services coordinate health services for the patient guide the patient through network of public services (health, welfare, etc.) provide best possible health/social services (in light of economic considerations) Principles # Social equity National coverage Self-reliance Inter-sectoral coordination People\u0026rsquo;s involvement in planning and implementation Basic Elements # Core activities and elements that PHC should have according to the Alma Ata declaration:\nEducation Treatment Preventing endemic disease Immunization Maternal and child health Nutrition and food supply Water and sanitation Drug availability Basic Requirements # The basic requirements can be divided into 8 As and 3 Cs:\nBasic requirement Explanation Aproppriateness Wether the service is needed, if it is then it needs to be carried out properly. Adequacy Sufficient volume of care to meet need/demand. Affordability Cost should be within means of the individual and country. Accessibility Easily reachable and convenient (geographically, economically, and culturally). Acceptability Trust and satisfactory communication between patient and HC providers. Accountability Regular reviews of financial records by public accountants. Asessability Medical care can be readily evaluated Availability Care can be obtained by people whenever needed (readily available). Completeness Focus on all aspects of problem (prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, follow-ups, rehab). Continuity Management of patient care is continued over time and coordinated among providers. Comprehensiveness Care is provided for all types of health problems. PHC Teams # PHC teams are teams of interprofessional health providers that provide comprehensive primary care.\nThe team works by combining knowledge, skills, and resources. All members share the responsibility for outcome. Each member understands his own functions and recognizes common interests. A PHC team is made up of:\nCounseling social workers, psychologists, and psycho-therapists Administrative Reception of clients Secretarial / clerical work Family health services (administered by Family Health Service Authorities \u0026ldquo;FHSAs\u0026rdquo;) GPs (general practicioners) dental practicioners pharmacists opticians Community health services community doctors dentists nurses, midwives, health visitors other allied professions (chiropody, physiotherapy, etc.) "},{"id":2,"href":"/mednotes/docs/notes/y2/s1/pathology/1.-inflammation-overview/","title":"1. Inflammation Overview","section":"Pathology","content":" Inflammation Overview # Vascularized tissue response to injury (e.g: infection or tissue damage) Cells/molecules are recruited from circulation and moved to site to eliminate offending agent. Inflammation is protective in nature. Cardinal Signs # Infl. has 5 major cardinal signs (cardinal sign = major signs/symptoms)\nRedness Swelling Heat Pain Loss of function e.g: cannot use toe with grout can be remembered with the song: Red, Swelling, Heat and Pain (heat and pain)! sung to the tune of \u0026ldquo;Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes\u0026rdquo;)\nstrep throat Damage # Inflammation is a benificial host response to foreign invaders and necrotic tissue. However, it may also cause damage.\nToo much can cause tissue damage. Too little can also cause damage (increased susceptibility to infections) Misdirected or chronic infl. can cause damage. autoimmune diseases are misdirected immune responses (e.g: immune response attacks kidney, not the strep throat) Chronic infl. can cause chronic disease Causes # Acute vs Chronic # Inflammations are generally divided into acute and chronic:\nAcute: immediate and early response quick, prominent, and mild Chronic: infl. of prolonged duration (weeks/months/years) slow, severe, and less prominent Acute inflammation either eliminates injurious agent, causing a decline of infl. and repair of damaged tissue, or it might result in chronic infl. if the injury persists.\nSometimes both acute and chronic can occur simultaneously. (e.g: basline chronic infl. + acute on top)\nFeature Acute Chronic Onset fast: mins or hrs slow: days Cellular infiltrate mainly neutrophils monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes Tissue injury, fibrosis usually mild/self-limited may be severe and progressive Local and systemic signs prominent less prominent professor said to know this table very well also important to know that acute infl. is hallmarked by the presence of neutrophils\nInflammation Steps (5 Rs) # The steps of inflammation can summed up in the \u0026ldquo;5 Rs\u0026rdquo;. They are, in order:\nRecognize: offending agent is recognized by cells/tissues Recruit: WBCs (leukocytes) and plasma proteins are recruited to the site of injury Remove: WBCs/Plasma Proteins work to remove injurious agent Regulate: response is regulated/controlled after removal of injurious agent Repair: repair of damaged tissue Try to put most of what you study within the context of the \u0026ldquo;5 Rs\u0026rdquo;.\nRecognition # Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). TLRs are cellular receptors normally present in membreanes and endosomes. Other sensors detect damage-associated molecul patterns (DAMPs) All these consequently activate inflammasomes (cytoplasmic proteins) and other proteins Summary\nGeneral features and causes of inflammation:\nbenificial host response to foreign invaders and necrotic tissue, but may also cause damage. inflammations steps can be remembered by the \u0026ldquo;5 Rs\u0026rdquo;: (1) recognition of injurious agent, (2) recruitment of leukocytes, (3) removal of agent, (4) regulation of response, (5) repair. inflammation causes include infections, tissue necrosis, foreign bodies, trauma, and immune responses. epithelial cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, leukocytes, and other types of cells express receptors that sense the presence of microbes and necrotic cells. outcome of inflammation is either elimination of stimulus (followed by decline of rxn and repair of damaged tissue), or the injury persists resulting in chronic inflammation.
