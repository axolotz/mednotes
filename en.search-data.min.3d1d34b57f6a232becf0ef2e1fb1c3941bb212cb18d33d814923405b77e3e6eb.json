Intro","section":"Community Medicine","content":" Overview # A community is a group of people living in the same place or having common characteristics (geography, interests, experiences, concerns, values, etc.).\nCommunity medicine primarily aims to prevent diseases and promote health deals with healthcare issues affecting communities as a whole Physicians, advanced practice nurse, and sometimes physician assistants can provide community medicine services. Community medicine requires a multidisciplinary approach (focuses on different disciplines/specialties)\nCore subjects involved in comm. med: epidemiology health-care delivery system biostatistics public health nutrition social, behavioural, environmental, and management sciences Health # \u0026ldquo;Health is the state of complete physical, mental, \u0026amp; social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease\u0026rdquo;. (WHO)\nHealth is not a single state, it always changes. It is dynamic and multidimensional (mental, spiritual, physical, etc.) Health results from one\u0026rsquo;s interactions/adaptations with/to their environment. Health status is determined by five domains: genetics social circumstances (education, income, etc.) behavioural choices (diet, exercise, etc.) environmental conditions availability of quality medical care Dimensions # Physical Dimension proper body functioning physical fitness activities of daily life (ADL) Mental Dimension ability to think/reason clearly freedom from internal conflict self-awareness good self-control ability to cope with stress Emotional Dimension self-efficacy and self-esteem Social Dimension ability to have satisfying relationships Spiritual Dimension feeling as a part of a greatur spectrum of existence Enviromental Dimension appreciation for external environment and one\u0026rsquo;s role in it Spectrum # Concept that health is dynamic/ever-changing, not a fixed state. A degradation in health is gradual, not sudden. Thus, health is a \u0026ldquo;spectrum\u0026rdquo; optimum health \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; better health \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; freedom from sickness \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; unrecognized sickness \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; mild sickness \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; severe \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; death Determinants # Health is influenced by many factors known as \u0026ldquo;determinants\u0026rdquo;.\nDefined as: the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age, and the wider set of forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life\u0026quot;. (WHO)\nSocial Determinants of Health can be grouped into 5 major domains:\nEconomic Stability Education access and quality Healthcare access and quality Neighborhood and built environment Social and community context Economic Stability Goal: help people earn steady incomes that allow them to meet their health needs. steady employment = less likely to live in poverty, more likely to be healthy. Education access and quality Goal: increase educational opportunities, help children/adolescents do well in school. higher levels of education = more likely to be healthier and live longer. Healthcare access and quality Goal: increase access to high-quality health care services. no insurance = less likely to have primary care provider, may not be able to afford the healthcare/medications strategies to increase insurance coverage rates help more people get access to important services (e.g: preventive care, treatment for chronic illnesses). Education access and quality Goal: create neighborhoods/environments that promote health and safety. some neighbourhoods may have high rates of violence, unsafe air/water, and other health/safety risks. racial/ethnic minorities and lower income individuals are more likely to live in such places. some work environments may harm health (e.g: secondhand smoke, loud noises, etc.). Social and community context Goal: Increase social and community support. relationships (family, friends, coworkers, etc.) can influence health.

Primary Health Care","section":"Community Medicine","content":" Overview # 3 levels of care: primary, secondary, tertiary\nPrimary first contact with patient responsible for preventative health care Secondary provides curative healthcare facilities patients with abnormalities are referred to secondary Tertiary provides more advanced curative healthcare facilities for specialized healthcare or when there are not enough facilities PHC initially gained gained global prominence in the 1978 Alma Ata Declaration in the Soviet Union.\nThe Alma Ata Declaration states:\nHealth is a fundamental human right and its attainment is an important worldwide social goal. Inequality in the health status of the people (especially between countries) is unacceptable. The people have the right to participate in the planning/implementation of their health care. Government are responsible for the health of their people (by providing adequate health and social measures) All governments should create policies and strategies to launch and sustain PHC All countries should cooperate to ensure PHC for all people Acceptable level of health for all people by year 2000 can be attained by better use of world\u0026rsquo;s resources Primary Health Care # PHC is first-level care provided to a community. It is the first point of contact with the healthcare system, usually through a family physician.\nPHC is rooted in the idea that health is a bio-psycho-social phenomenon, not simply the absence of disease.\nPHC is:\nEssential healthcare Universally accessible to individuals Acceptable to them Through their participation At a cost the community and country can afford This can be remembered with the abreviation EUAPC\nPHC includes:\nHealth promotion Illnes prevention Care of the sick Advocacy Community Development Functions # provide continous and comprehensive care refer to specialists and/or hostpital services coordinate health services for the patient guide the patient through network of public services (health, welfare, etc.) provide best possible health/social services (in light of economic considerations) Principles # Social equity National coverage Self-reliance Inter-sectoral coordination People\u0026rsquo;s involvement in planning and implementation Basic Elements # Core activities and elements that PHC should have according to the Alma Ata declaration:\nEducation Treatment Preventing endemic disease Immunization Maternal and child health Nutrition and food supply Water and sanitation Drug availability Basic Requirements # The basic requirements can be divided into 8 As and 3 Cs:\nBasic requirement Explanation Aproppriateness Wether the service is needed, if it is then it needs to be carried out properly. Adequacy Sufficient volume of care to meet need/demand. Affordability Cost should be within means of the individual and country. Accessibility Easily reachable and convenient (geographically, economically, and culturally). Acceptability Trust and satisfactory communication between patient and HC providers. Accountability Regular reviews of financial records by public accountants. Asessability Medical care can be readily evaluated Availability Care can be obtained by people whenever needed (readily available). Completeness Focus on all aspects of problem (prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, follow-ups, rehab). Continuity Management of patient care is continued over time and coordinated among providers. Comprehensiveness Care is provided for all types of health problems. PHC Teams # PHC teams are teams of interprofessional health providers that provide comprehensive primary care.\nThe team works by combining knowledge, skills, and resources. All members share the responsibility for outcome. Each member understands his own functions and recognizes common interests. A PHC team is made up of:\nCounseling social workers, psychologists, and psycho-therapists Administrative Reception of clients Secretarial / clerical work Family health services (administered by Family Health Service Authorities \u0026ldquo;FHSAs\u0026rdquo;) GPs (general practicioners) dental practicioners pharmacists opticians Community health services community doctors dentists nurses, midwives, health visitors other allied professions (chiropody, physiotherapy, etc.) "},{"id":2,"href":"/mednotes/docs/notes/y2/s1/pathology/1.-inflammation-overview/","title":"1. Inflammation Overview","section":"Pathology","content":" Inflammation Overview # Vascularized tissue response to injury (e.g: infection or tissue damage) Cells/molecules are recruited from circulation and moved to site to eliminate offending agent. Inflammation is protective in nature. Cardinal Signs # Infl. has 5 major cardinal signs (cardinal sign = major signs/symptoms)\nRedness Swelling Heat Pain Loss of function e.g: cannot use toe with grout can be remembered with the song: Red, Swelling, Heat and Pain (heat and pain)! sung to the tune of \u0026ldquo;Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes\u0026rdquo;)\nstrep throat Damage # Inflammation is a benificial host response to foreign invaders and necrotic tissue. However, it may also cause damage.\nToo much can cause tissue damage. Too little can also cause damage (increased susceptibility to infections) Misdirected or chronic infl. can cause damage. autoimmune diseases are misdirected immune responses (e.g: immune response attacks kidney, not the strep throat) Chronic infl. can cause chronic disease Causes # Acute vs Chronic # Inflammations are generally divided into acute and chronic:\nAcute: immediate and early response quick, prominent, and mild Chronic: infl. of prolonged duration (weeks/months/years) slow, severe, and less prominent Acute inflammation either eliminates injurious agent, causing a decline of infl. and repair of damaged tissue, or it might result in chronic infl. if the injury persists.\nSometimes both acute and chronic can occur simultaneously. (e.g: basline chronic infl. + acute on top)\nFeature Acute Chronic Onset fast: mins or hrs slow: days Cellular infiltrate mainly neutrophils monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes Tissue injury, fibrosis usually mild/self-limited may be severe and progressive Local and systemic signs prominent less prominent professor said to know this table very well also important to know that acute infl. is hallmarked by the presence of neutrophils\nInflammation Steps (5 Rs) # The steps of inflammation can summed up in the \u0026ldquo;5 Rs\u0026rdquo;. They are, in order:\nRecognize: offending agent is recognized by cells/tissues Recruit: WBCs (leukocytes) and plasma proteins are recruited to the site of injury Remove: WBCs/Plasma Proteins work to remove injurious agent Regulate: response is regulated/controlled after removal of injurious agent Repair: repair of damaged tissue Try to put most of what you study within the context of the \u0026ldquo;5 Rs\u0026rdquo;.\nRecognition # Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). TLRs are cellular receptors normally present in membreanes and endosomes. Other sensors detect damage-associated molecul patterns (DAMPs) All these consequently activate inflammasomes (cytoplasmic proteins) and other proteins Summary\nGeneral features and causes of inflammation:\nbenificial host response to foreign invaders and necrotic tissue, but may also cause damage. inflammations steps can be remembered by the \u0026ldquo;5 Rs\u0026rdquo;: (1) recognition of injurious agent, (2) recruitment of leukocytes, (3) removal of agent, (4) regulation of response, (5) repair. inflammation causes include infections, tissue necrosis, foreign bodies, trauma, and immune responses. epithelial cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, leukocytes, and other types of cells express receptors that sense the presence of microbes and necrotic cells. outcome of inflammation is either elimination of stimulus (followed by decline of rxn and repair of damaged tissue), or the injury persists resulting in chronic inflammation. "},{"id":3,"href":"/mednotes/docs/notes/y2/s1/pathology/2.-acute-inflammation/","title":"2. Acute Inflammation","section":"Pathology","content":" Acute Inflammation Overview # Acute inflammation lasts minutes to days. It is characterized by exudation of fluid and plasma protein and emigration of leukocytes (predominantly neotrophils).\nAcute inflammations have 2 major components:\nVascular changes (vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, etc.) Cellular changes (leukocyte migration then elimination of injurious agent) Previously we have talked about R1 (recognition). These notes talk about R2 (recruitment) and R3 (removal). Vascular and cellular changes discussed here are within R2 and R3.\nto better organize your thoughts, look at the content list on the top right of the page.\nVascular Responses # Vascular changes include:\nvasodilation increased vascular permeability Lymph vessels may also participate Vasodilation # Histamine is the major mediator of vasodilation vasodilation leads to increased blood flow increased blood flow causes erythema (redness) and heat Increased Vascular Permeability # Normally, there is zero net flow in/out of vessels. Vascular leakage usually indicates a problem.\nDuring vascular leakage, either fluid alone is leaking out, or fluid+proteins.\nWhen vessels are \u0026ldquo;tight\u0026rdquo;, only fluid will leak out, but larger proteins will not be able to (transudate) When endothelial cells \u0026ldquo;loosen up\u0026rdquo; and create gaps, proteins will leak out with the fluid (exudate) Therefore, vascular leakage is either transudate or exudate. Exudate is a leakage of proteins+fluid from the vessels out into tissues. Transudate is mostly fluid only.\nTransudate Exudate low protein high protein low cell content many cells and debris low specific gravity high specific gravity caused by osmotic/hydrostatic pressure imbalance caused by increased vascular permeability and denotes inflammatory rxn During infl., histamine and other mediators cause retraction of endothelial cells. this creates little gaps causing protein leakage (i.e: exudate) (see image above) thus, inflammation is usually associated with exudate Edema can be either transudate or exudate Pus is only exudative (pus is purulent, meaning very rich in proteins, leukocytes, etc.)\nexudate generally indicates inflammation, cancer, or other severe condition. it is thick, creamy (due to protein content), and may be bloody exudate is usually colored, while transudate is transparent. helpful video: https://youtu.be/sLlHRNMbyv0?t=12\neye with conjunctivitis exuding pus Lymph Nodes # Lymphatic vessels also participate in acute inflammation.\nNormally, lymphatics drain extravascular fluid. During inflammation however, lymph flow is increased to help drain edema fluid that accumulates from the increased vascular permeability.\nLymph channels drain into lymph nodes. Therefore, lymph channel inflammation may cause enlargement of the nodes.\nLymphangitis: inflammation of lymphatic channels. Lymphandenitis: lymph node enlargement. Lymphangitis Lymphandenitis prof mentioned that these are common issues you will see in clinical years\nSummary (vascular responses)\nVasodilation is induced by inflammatory mediators such as histamine, and is the cause of erythema and stasis of blood flow. Increased vascular permeability is induced by histamine, kinins, and other mediators that produce gaps between endothelial cells, by direct or leukocyte-induced endothelial injury, and by increased passage of fluids through the endothelium. Increased vascular permeability allows plasma proteins and leukocytes, the mediators of host defense, to enter sites of infection or tissue damage. Fluid leak from blood vessels (exudation) results in edema. Lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes also are involved in inflammation, and often show redness and swelling. Cellular Responses # Almost all leukocytes play a role in inflammation. However, macrophages and neutrophils play the main role in acute inflammations.\nNeutrophils and macrophages function to:\nEliminate microbes via phagocytosis Secrete mediators to recruit more inflammatory cells at injury site This is done in 3 main steps:\nEmigration (leukocytes going out of blood vessels and into tissue) Chemotaxis (leukocyte movement towards the injury site) Leukocyte Activation (elimination of the injurious agent) Emigration # Emigration is the passage of inflammatory leukocytes between the endothelial cells from blood vessels into the adjacent interstitial tissue. Before emigration, circulating leukocytes from the central blood flow move toward the endothelial surface.\nThis process is also known as: leokocyte extravasation or leukocyte adhesion cascade.\nEmigration includes 4 main steps: Margination Rolling Adhesion Transmigration Margination movement of neutrophils from the center of the lumen towards the wall Rolling endothelial selectins loosely bind to the leukocytes selectins are proteins present in endothelial cells and are responsible for the initial weak attachement with WBCs. weak binding/attachement causes leukocytes to \u0026ldquo;roll\u0026rdquo; along the endothelial surface Adhesion leukocytes bind much more strongly due to integrins. integrin proteins mediate stronger adhesion to the endothelial surface. integrins are on the leukocytes, but they bind to integrin ligands on the endothelium. ICAM-1 ligand attachement is now much stronger than previous stage (\u0026ldquo;adhered\u0026rdquo; to the endothelium) Remember: selectins \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; weak attachement \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; rolling. integrins \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; strong attachement \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; adhesion.\nSo far, the leukocyte has been slowed down and \u0026ldquo;prepared\u0026rdquo; to move out of the blood vessel (into adjecent interstitial tissue).\nTransmigration leukocytes move across the endothelium endothelial cells are damaged (hole is made) to allow leukocyte to squeeze out transmigration is mediated by CD31 protein CD31 is also called PECAM-1 (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1) CD31 utilizes collagenase to degrade basement membrane leukocyte gets out of blood vessel and into the interstitial tissue Side Note: Some textbooks use the term \u0026ldquo;dipedesis\u0026rdquo; to refer to the entire emigration process, while some use it to refer to the transmigration phase only.\nhelpful video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Qi7we0Ynk\nChemotaxis # After leaving the blood vessels, leukocytes need to reach the site of injury.\nChemotaxis is the active process where phagocytes move toward an increasing concentration of some attractant (they taxi towards injury, just like how planes taxi towards runways).\nBasically: it is the movement of leukocytes/WBCs to the injury site right after leaving the blood vessel.\nChemotaxis is induced by mediators called chemoattractants Both exogenous and endogenous substances can act as chemoattractants Examples of chemoattractants include: bacterial products, particularly peptides with N-\u0026hellip; termini cytokines, espcially ones of chemokine family components of the complement system, particularly C5a products of lipoxygenase pathway of AA metabolism, particularly LTB4 Remember the major chemoattractants very well\nThese chemoattractants attract leukocytes. The nature of leukocyte infiltrate in the tissues depends on the inflammation\u0026rsquo;s age and stimulus type.\nTherefore we can determine the nature of the inflammation by determining the nature of the leukocyte infiltrate.\nneutrophils 6-24 hrs, acute phase macrophages and lymphocytes 24-48 hrs, maybe more eosinophils allergic rxns Remember from last set of notes, neutrophils are the hallmark of acute inflammatory rxns.\nImage (A) on the left has a lot of neutrophils (multilobed nuclei, \u0026ldquo;mickey mouse\u0026rdquo; shaped cells), therefore it is an acute inflammation. Image on the right (B) includes macrophages and lymphocytes, therefore it is probably more chronic. there may be overlap between the steps, but that does not change their order (see chart)\nprof. mentioned that this chart may come on the exam labelled A, B, C and you must know each stage.\nExample cases (that prof. mentioned during the lec):\n15 y/o girl suffering pain around umbilicus, later radiated to right iliac fossa. Diagnosed with acute appendicitis, underwent appendectomy. Appendix was examined, high amount of neutrophils found, this proved the diagnosis (acute appendicitis).\nA 39 y/o man came in with chest pain, physician gave him ibuprofen, patient died 6 hrs later. Section of the heart was taken, high amount of neutrophils were found, indicating acute myocardial infarction.\nLeukocyte Activation # Neutrophils and monocytes are the most important phagocytic cells.\nPhagocytosis includes three sequential steps:\nRecognition and attachement Engulfement Killing and degradation We are now discussing R3 (removal). Emigration and chemotaxis were part of R2 (recruitment).\nRecognition and attachement carried out by mannose receptors and opsonins (IgG, C3B) Engulfment forms phagosome (phagocytic vacoule) Killing and degradation active process of degradation and intracellular killing is done by neutrophil\u0026rsquo;s bactericides most potent microbicidials are reactive oxygen species (ROS), Nitric Oxide, and NO.H2O2-MPO-halide Nitric Oxide is a soluble gas produced from Arginine by NOS (nitric oxide synthase) 3 types of NOS: eNOS, nNOS, iNOS iNOS is responsible for intracellular killing and is stimulated by interferon-γ (IFN-γ) rxts with superoxide to form radical peroxynitrite prof. mentioned that NO.H2O2-MPO-halide is possibly the most potent neutrophil bactericide\nThe quantities of H2O2 produced generally are insufficient to kill most bacteria. However, the granules (lysosomes) of neutrophils contain enzymes.\n2 types: large primary granules (azurophilic) and secondary granules primary contain MPO enzyme secondary contain lysozyme, etc. Granules are neutralized (kept in check) by anti-proteases (e.g: α-1 antitrypsin) α-1 antitrypsin inhibits elastases α-1 antitrypsin deficiency can lead chronic disease and injury phagocytosis of a bacterium, notice how a lysosome (granule) fuses with the phagosome neutrophil engulfing thrush fungus (SEM) Neutrophils also secrete \u0026ldquo;neutrophil extracellular traps\u0026rdquo; (NETs).\nWhen the neutrophil dies, chromatin material will spill outside NETs are a meshwork of thick viscous nuclear chromatin after the neutrophil dies prevent the spread of the microbes (trap) NETs play a major role in the pathogenesis of spesis/septicemia Maybe involved in SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus) multisystem autoimmune disease affects young females, causes rash on cheeks prof. metioned that the most dangerous septicemia is gram negative septic shock\ncells (orange) caught in neutrophil extracellular traps (green) Activated leukocytes/WBCs also serve to:\nserve to amplify or limit immune rxn (via cytokines) growth factor secretion for repair T-helper-17 is a major player in acute inflammation produces IL-17 IL-17 deficiency can cause disease Leukocyte Mediated Tissue Injury # Because leukocytes are capable of secreting potentially harmful substances such as enzymes and ROS, they are important causes of injury to normal cells and tissues under several circumstances. These circumstances include:\nProlonged inflammation e.g: tubercolosis (TB) or hepatitis Inappropriate inflammatory responses autoimmune diseases Exaggerated responses e.g: asthma and allergic rxns "},{"id":4,"href":"/mednotes/docs/notes/y2/s1/pathology/3.-mediators/","title":"3. Mediators","section":"Pathology","content":" Overview # To avoid tissue injury, the inflammatory response needs to be controlled and regulated.\nThere are mechanisms in place to control, regulate, and eventually terminate the inflammatory response:\nmediators are produced in rapid bursts (not continous) release is stimulus dependent short half-lives degrade after release neutrophil/PMN short life production of stop signals at the end of IR there are neural inhibitors There are major general features of mediators of inflammation:\nderived at site of injury plasma proteins need activation, active mediators need stimulation most mediators have short lifespan one can activate the other Somewhere along this point the prof. puts up a table of mediators that we are supposed to know. Leave it for now, study it at the end of mediators, it will be easier after you go through the lesson. You will be a lot more familiar with them, and they will be easier to remember.\nArachidonic Acid Metabolites # The lipid mediators prostaglandins and leukotrienes are produced from arachidonic acid, they stimulate vascular and cellular rxns in acute inflammation.\nMediators derived from arachidonic acid are called eicosanoids (prof. hates that name).\nArachidonic acid is present in membrane phospholipids. A stimulus or mediator (e.g: C5a) can trigger the release of that arachidonic acid by activating phospholipase. Phospholipase damages the membrane, releasing the arachidonic acid. Once out of the membrane, enzymes rapidly convert arachidonic acid into bioactive mediators. These enzymes are either cyclooxygenases or lipoxygenases. cyclooxygenases generate prostaglandins lipoxygenases produce leukotrienes and lipoxins To sum up: arachidonic acid exists inside the phospholipid membrane. A stimulus acivates phospholipase, damaging the membrane, which releases the acid. Enzymes then convert the acid into mediators. This can go two ways, either the enzyme is a cyclooxygenase or a lipoxygenase. Depending on the enzyme you get different mediators.\nproduction of AA metabolites and their role in inflammation COX Products # See image above for reference.\nPGI2 causes vasodilation while TXA2 causes vasoconstriction PGI2 inhibits platelet aggregation, while TXA2 promotes platelet aggregation An imbalance between PGI2 and TXA2 can possibly cause ischemic heart disease atherosclerosis or cerebrovascular accident (stroke) professor mentioned that PGI2 and TXA2 will come on the exam\nPGD2 and PGE2 have a less critical function, they serve to vasodilate and increase vascular permeability.\nLOX Products # Lipooxygenase products include leukotrienes (LT) and lipoxins\nLTB4\u0026rsquo;s main function is as a chemoattractant for chemotaxis LTC4, D4, E4 play a role in bronchospasms and increase in vasc. permeability thus they are targeted for therapy to control asthma attacks Lipoxin A4 and Lipoxin B4 make general inhibition of inflammation, particularly anti-chemotaxis.\nAction Eicosanoid/AA Metabolite Vasodilation PGI2, PGE1, PGE2, PGD2 Vasoconstriction TXA2, leukotrienes C4, D4, E4 Increased vascular permeability leukotrienes C4, D4, E4 Chemotaxis, leukocyte adhesion LTB4 Smooth muscle contraction Prostaglandins C4, D4, E4 Pharmacologic Inhibitors # As seen in the image above, some drugs target this process.\nSteroids very strong and potent anti-inflamamtory drugs inhibit phospholipase thus entirely inhibit both pathways COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors, aspirin, indomethacin called \u0026ldquo;anti-prostaglandins\u0026rdquo; inhibit cyclooxygenases thus only inhibit prostaglandin production Lipooxygenase inhibitors inhibit lipooxygenase thus only inhibit leukotriene and lipoxin production Steroids are the strongest, the other two types are not as strong.\nSummary (AA metabolites)\nAspirin inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) Steroids inhibit phospholipase and are anti-inflammatory Prostacyclin (PGI2) vasodilator and inhibits platelet aggregation. TXA2 vasoconstrictor and promotes platelet aggregation. TXA2 and PGI2 imbalance can lead to ischemic heart disease (IHD) and CV (stroke). PGE2 is a major mediator for pain and fever. Cytokines # Cytokines are secreted by many cells predominantly activated lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells.\nThey mediate and regulate immune and inflamamtory response.\nCytokine Principal Sources Principal Actions in Inflammation In Acute Inflammation TNF IL-1 IL-6 Chemokines IL-17 T lymphocytes recruitment of nuetrophils and monocytes In Chronic Inflammation IL-12 IL-γ T-lymphocytes, NK cells IL-17 T lymphocytes recruitment of nuetrophils and monocytes Major Effects # Cytokines can serve multiple major effects. These include:\nLocal inflammation Systemic protective effects Systemic pathologic effects systemic means affecting the entire body, rather than a single organ or body part\nmajor roles of cytokines in acute inflammation Local inflammation are the local effects we mentioned before Systemic protective effects induce fever acute-phase proteins in the liver stimulate more hematopoietic cells in bone marrow Systemic pathologic effects can affect heart causing low output or heart failure TNF may cause platelet aggregation and thrombus formation may cause ischemia in the heart or other organs TNF may also cause insulin resistance Chemokines # Family of cytokines. Small proteins, mainly chemoattractants.\nAct via G-protein coupled receptors Serve 2 main functions inflammation maintaining tissue architecture Complement System # The complement system is a collection of soluble proteins and their membrane receptors that function mainly in host defense against microbes and in pathologic inflammatory rxns.\nComplement system activation is also known as \u0026ldquo;complement fixation\u0026rdquo;.\nInactive proteins that need activation More than 20 C1-C9 are the most common C3 specifically is the most common cleavage of C3 activates the complement system Important in innate and adaptive immunity Functions vascular permeability chemotaxis opsonitzation Activation Pathways # There are 3 pathways for C3 activation (which activates the complement system cascade):\nAlternative pathway Classical pathway Lectin pathway Alternative pathway triggered by bacterial polysaccharides Classical pathway triggered by antigen-antibody complex invader produces antibodies, antibody joins antigens, the antigen-antibody triggers activation Lectin pathway triggered by mannose receptor binding to lectin After that, activated C3 goes into 3 pathways (image above):\nC5a, C3a Inflammation C3a (active part) functions as a chemotactic agent to recruit/activate leukocytes. This induces the production of C5a and C3a C3b Phagocytosis C3b is important in stimulating phagocytosis. assists macrophages and neutrophils in phagocytosis.
